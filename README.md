## API Authentication with Laravel Sanctum

### Why Sanctum?

We chose **Laravel Sanctum** for API authentication because:

- ✅ **Native Integration**: Included in Laravel 12, no external dependencies
- ✅ **Simple Setup**: Quick configuration with minimal overhead
- ✅ **Security**: SHA-256 hashed tokens stored in database, instantly revocable
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Supports both SPA session authentication and API token authentication
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Used by Laravel ecosystem, battle-tested in enterprise applications
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against brute force attacks

For **simple projects**, Sanctum is more than sufficient and provides enterprise-level security without complexity.

## Database Schema

The application includes a basic CRM structure with referential integrity constraints:

### Tables

- **customers**: Client information (name, email, address, phone)
- **orders**: Customer orders with foreign key relationship

### Key Constraints

- **Soft Deletes**: Both customers and orders use soft deletes (deleted_at column)
- **Referential Integrity**: Orders have a foreign key to customers with `RESTRICT ON DELETE`
- **Data Protection**: A customer cannot be deleted if they have existing orders
- **Order Status**: ENUM values (pending, processing, completed, cancelled)

This ensures data integrity and prevents orphaned records while maintaining audit trails through soft deletes.

## API Resources

The application uses **Laravel API Resources** to format and control JSON responses:

### Why API Resources?

- ✅ **Data Control**: Expose only necessary fields per endpoint
- ✅ **Format Consistency**: Automatic date formatting and data transformation
- ✅ **Performance**: Conditional loading prevents N+1 queries
- ✅ **Context Aware**: Different data based on route (list vs detail)

### Implementation

- **CustomerResource**: Shows basic info in lists, full details (including address) in show endpoints
- **OrderResource**: Formats amounts, dates, and includes human-readable status labels
- **Conditional Fields**: Uses `whenLoaded()` and `when()` to include data only when appropriate

## API Endpoints

All API endpoints require authentication using **Laravel Sanctum** tokens.

### Base URL
```
http://localhost:8080/api
```

### Authentication
```http
GET /api/user
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```
Returns authenticated user information.

| `GET` | `/customers` | List all customers with pagination |
| `POST` | `/customers` | Create a new customer |

| `PUT` | `/customers/{id}` | Update customer |

| `GET` | `/customers/{id}/orders` | Get customer's orders |

### Orders
